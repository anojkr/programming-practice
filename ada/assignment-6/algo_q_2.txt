Algorithm

Reverse both linked lists
Make a linked list of maximum result size (m + n + 1)
For each node of one list
  For each node of second list
   a) Multiply nodes
   b) Add digit in result LL at corresponding 
      position
   c) Now resultant node itself can be higher
      than one digit
   d) Make carry for next node
  Leave one last column means next time start
From next node in result list
Reverse the resulted linked list
