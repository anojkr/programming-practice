That probably is an issue to do with the ISA proxy setup in your organization. I had the same issue when configuring a virtual server for my organization.

Open the terminal. In the terminal type in the following command:

sudo nano /etc/apt/apt.conf

This command is meant to open up the apt.conf file and make it available for configuration. If you are prompted for your password, enter it.

Add the following lines into the file:

Acquire::http::proxy "http://[username]:[password]@[proxy_address]:[port]";
Acquire::https::proxy "https:// [username]:[password]@[proxy_address]:[port]";
Acquire::ftp::proxy "ftp:// [username]:[password]@[proxy_address]:[port]";
Acquire::socks::proxy "[username]:[password]@[proxy_address]:[port]";

Where: username - Your proxy username password - Your proxy password proxy_address - The address of the proxy server port - The port on the address server through which traffic is allowed

Save the apt.conf file. Try and run the apt-get command and it should give you something similar to this

sudo apt-get install [package]
